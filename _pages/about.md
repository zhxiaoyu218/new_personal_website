I have received M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering: Robotics from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). Prior to that, I had obtained my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with high distinction from the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/). After I graduated from Umich, I was working as a research and development engineer at Intelligent Driving Group in [Baidu](http://usa.baidu.com/adu/).

My life-long goal is to build the autonomous robots that can better serve and collaborate with people, like what human beings do. With this goal in mind, my research interest is to create the algorithms for the robot to physically interact with world or collobrate with people. 

What is the way of the good research or thinking? I think it should be to think like an amateur and to do as an expert, which is the name of a book wrote by Prof. Takeo Kanade to introduce how he feels about good research.
